# QR-code-Generator
In this project, I developed a dynamic and user-friendly webpage that allows users to effortlessly convert any text or link into a QR code. The primary purpose of this tool is to provide a quick and easy way to generate QR codes that can be scanned for instant access to URLs or to share information seamlessly.  This project is implemented using foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features :
1.Real-time QR Code Generation:
  Upon entering the text or URL, the user can simply click a button to generate the QR code instantly.
  The generated QR code is displayed immediately on the same page, making the process swift and efficient.
2.Intuitive User Interface:
  The webpage features a clean and minimalistic design, ensuring a straightforward user experience.
  Input fields are prominently displayed, guiding users to enter either a URL or plain text.
3.Technology Stack:
  HTML: Structuring the webpage, including input forms and buttons.
  CSS: Styling the webpage to enhance visual appeal and improve user interaction.
  JavaScript: Implementing the core functionality to generate QR codes from the user input.

Implementation Details:
HTML:
  The HTML file includes input fields for the URL/text and a button to trigger the QR code generation.
  It also contains a section to display the generated QR code.
CSS:
  Responsive design principles are applied to ensure the webpage looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
JavaScript:
  JavaScript handles the logic for taking user input, processing it, and generating the corresponding QR code.

Working :
User Input:
  The user enters a URL or any text into the designated input field on the webpage.
QR Code Generation:
  Upon clicking the "Generate QR Code" button, a JavaScript function is triggered.
  This function processes the input and uses a QR code generation library to create a QR code.
Display and Usage:
  The generated QR code is displayed on the same page, allowing the user to scan it with any QR code reader.
  Users can open the QR code in their Chrome browser for further actions.
